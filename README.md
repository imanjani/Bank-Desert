# Bank-Desert

This Project uncovers the well-known phenomenon of Banking Deserts. The concept is simple: many neighborhoods with predominantly low-income and elderly populations tend to have inadequate coverage of banking services. This leads such communities to be vulnerable to predatory loan and pricey check casher providers.

In this script, we retrieved and plotted data from the 2013 US Census and Google Places API to show the relationship between various socioeconomic parameters and bank count across 700 randomly selected zip codes. We used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Requests, Census API, and Google API to accomplish our task.


* In this activity your broad task is to answer the question: "What is the relationship between poverty, age, and population with the number of banks in a given area?" To help accomplish this task, you've been given census data for every zip code across the country. Your immediate task is to randomly sample a set of 700+ zip codes and then utilize both the Google Geocoder and Google Places Radar APIs to identify the number of banks in each of these zip codes within a 5 mile radius of a given point. Once you have the "bank counts", you'll then create a series of scatter plots comparing each of the following:

  * Population vs. Bank Count

  * Median Age vs. Bank Count

  * Household Income vs. Bank Count

  * Per Capita Income vs. Bank Count

  * Poverty Rate vs. Bank Count
